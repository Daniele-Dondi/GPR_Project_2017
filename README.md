# GPR_Project_2017
A cheap GPR prototype has been developed by the workgroup of COST Action TU1208.

# List of Files:
Python_GUI_4_Sliders_2.py      - software in Python, provides GUI to control the radar

Calc_DAC_with_Predistortion.py - software in Python, imported in "Python_GUI_4_Sliders_2.py" to precalculate DAC values

gpr_icon.ico,  GPR_logo.gif  - images used in the GUI

Mbed_Python_Control_LPC1768_2.bin      - firmware to load on LPC microcontroller

Mbed_Python_Control_LPC1768_2_main.txt - same firmware to read the code in the text format

TU1208_Guide to building a GPR radar for educational use _FINAL.pdf - Developer's Guide, see page 2 to reference this project


# Notice 
that there are no PCB designs (since I participated only in the software and firmware development and don't have them) and no tutorial for designing antennas so far. If you make ones, publish your results and send me a link - this could be a valuable contribution to this project and beneficial for other researchers.
